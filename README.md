# Self-Supervised Learning for Anomalous Sound Detection

### Kevin Wilkinghoff

ASD system utilizing supervised and self-supervised learning for acoustic machine condition monitoring. The script is designed to be evaluated with output files of the anomaly detection tasks of the [DCASE Challenge](https://dcase.community/challenge2023/task-first-shot-unsupervised-anomalous-sound-detection-for-machine-condition-monitoring).

## Instructions

Just start the main.py script for training and evaluation. To run the code, you need to download the development dataset, additional training dataset and the evaluation dataset, and store the files in an './eval_data' and a './dev_data' folder.

## Reference

When reusing (parts of) the code, a reference to the following paper would be appreciated:
